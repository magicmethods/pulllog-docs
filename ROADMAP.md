# PullLog Roadmap (Public)

This roadmap lists **planned improvements** for PullLog that can be shared publicly.  
Timelines are approximate and subject to change.

---

## ✅ Recently Delivered
- Basic gacha log management (multi-app, multi-currency)
- Statistics & visualization (drop rates, monthly expenses, expense ratio)
- Google account login
- Multi-language support (EN / JP / ZH)

---

## 📌 Planned (Next 3–6 months)

### Q4 2025
- **Custom tags & advanced filters**  
  Allow users to classify pulls with flexible labels and filter logs more precisely.

- **Improved import/export**  
  Bulk import of CSV/JSON logs and easier export options.

### Q1 2026
- **Cloud storage integration (PoC)**  
  Enable optional linkage to user-provided storage (Google Drive, Dropbox) for images.  
  ⚠️ Still under consideration due to cost implications.

- **Enhanced UI for log entry**  
  Further minimize clicks for daily input, add keyboard shortcuts.

## 🎯 Under Consideration
- **Auto-generated share images**  
  Create social-media-ready summary images of statistics.  
  (Evaluating actual demand before implementation)

- **Community features**  
  Compare drop statistics with friends or community averages.  
  (Long-term vision, requires privacy & scalability review)

---

## 📉 Not Planned
- Public API for direct log manipulation (security/privacy risks)
- Third-party login providers beyond Google (maintenance cost vs. benefit currently low)

---

## 📒 Notes
- Development resources: solo indie dev (~4 person-months so far)
- Priorities are adjusted based on feedback via Issues/Discussions in this repository
